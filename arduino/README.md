# Arduino program for operation of stepper motors
## Description
Arduino program to move the automated fixture's steppers.

### Features
 - [x] Specification of hardware arrangement through the assignment of 
   global variables at the beginning of the file.
 - [x] Specification of operating conditions by assigning the motion 
   parameters at the beginning of the file.
 - [x] Easy configuration of setup procedure in the `loop()` function 
   body by using the predefined `MOVE` and `HOME` macros along with the
